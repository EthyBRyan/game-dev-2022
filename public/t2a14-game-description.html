<h1>Game Description</h1>
My game is a 2D platformer with regular left and right movement, but up and down changes the gravity.<br>
Up changes the gravity to pull you up, and down changes the gravity to pull you down.<br>
You can only change the gravity if you are on solid ground.<br>
Falling to the bottom or top of the screen will cause you to lose.<br>
Touching the spikes will also cause you to lose.
